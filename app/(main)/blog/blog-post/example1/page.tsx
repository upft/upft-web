            I am returning to OpenAI as CEO. Mira will return to her role as
            CTO. The new initial board will consist of Bret Taylor (Chair),
            Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo. I have never been more excited
            about the future. I am extremely grateful for everyone’s hard work
            in an unclear and unprecedented situation, and I believe our
            resilience and spirit set us apart in the industry. I feel so, so
            good about our probability of success for achieving our mission.
            Before getting to what comes next, I’d like to share some thanks. I
            love and respect Ilya, I think he's a guiding light of the field and
            a gem of a human being. I harbor zero ill will towards him. While
            Ilya will no longer serve on the board, we hope to continue our
            working relationship and are discussing how he can continue his work
            at OpenAI. I am grateful to Adam, Tasha, and Helen for working with
            us to come to this solution that best serves the mission. I’m
            excited to continue to work with Adam and am sincerely thankful to
            Helen and Tasha for investing a huge amount of effort in this
            process. Thank you also to Emmett who had a key and constructive
            role in helping us reach this outcome. Emmett’s dedication to AI
            safety and balancing stakeholders’ interests was clear. Mira did an
            amazing job throughout all of this, serving the mission, the team,
            and the company selflessly throughout. She is an incredible leader
            and OpenAI would not be OpenAI without her. Thank you.

            Update on December 8, 2023 from Bret Taylor, Chair, OpenAI Board

            As previously stated, the OpenAI Board convened a committee
            consisting of Bret Taylor and Larry Summers to oversee the review of
            recent events. The committee interviewed several leading law firms
            to conduct the review, and ultimately selected Anjan Sahni and
            Hallie B. Levin from WilmerHale. Anjan and Hallie have extensive
            experience, and we have full confidence in their ability to conduct
            an effective and timely review. While the review is ongoing, the
            Board will continue to take steps to strengthen OpenAI’s corporate
            governance, build a qualified and diverse board of exceptional
            individuals, and oversee OpenAI’s important mission in ensuring that
            artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.
